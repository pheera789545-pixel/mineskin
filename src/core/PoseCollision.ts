 * *in* the surface of the part next to it. A shoulder lies in the torso's side
 * face, one unit below the arm's own top; the arm's top face is also the head's
 * bottom plane. Rotating a rigid box about a point on a wall always drives some

 * in any direction but two, and the feature reads as broken rather than solid.
 *
 * `joint` trims the collider back along the part's long axis, away from the end
 * it pivots about, so what gets tested is the part of the limb a user is
 * actually aiming — the forearm and the hand — and not the stump that has to
 * clip, exactly as it does in-game.
 *
 * `side` is the remaining clearance off every face. The torso keeps a hair,
 * enough that boxes touching at rest do not read as already colliding; limbs
 * and the head give up more, which is what buys back the ordinary poses (arm
 * forward, back, out to the side, raised in front) whose corners would
 * otherwise catch on a face they already touch. Tuned against those poses on
