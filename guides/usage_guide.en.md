---

## Overview

MineSkin PRO is a Minecraft skin editor and previewer with a real-time 3D view. It runs entirely on your device — in the browser, or as the iOS and Android app. Paint pixel by pixel directly on the 3D model, keep a library of skins, pick colors from reference images, and export a finished PNG for Minecraft.

---

## Getting Started

### First-Time Users

In the iOS and Android app, a short welcome flow greets you on first launch so you can set your language and cookie preferences. On the web there's no welcome flow — just a cookie prompt.

Either way, the first time you open **Editor** mode an interactive tutorial walks you through the basics. You can restart it anytime from **Settings → Help → Restart Tutorial**.

### Quick Start

1. Open the **Library** from the bottom bar and create a skin — start from a template, upload a PNG, or import one from a Minecraft username.
2. Pick a color, then choose a brush from the **Brushes** button in the left toolbar.
3. Paint directly on the 3D model.
4. Your work saves to the library automatically. To get a PNG out, open the **Library** and choose **Download** on the skin.
5. Upload that PNG to Minecraft — see [Use Your Skin in Minecraft](#use-your-skin-in-minecraft).

---

## Modes

Switch modes with the selector in the bottom bar.

### Editor Mode

- All drawing tools, brushes, and reference images
- Real-time 3D preview while you paint
- Undo/redo, grid, symmetry

### Preview Mode

- View your skin in 3D without editing tools
- Play animations, follow the cursor with the head
- Take screenshots and record shareable clips

---

## Your Skin Library

Open **Library** from the bottom bar. It holds every skin you've made, with the active one marked.

### Creating a Skin

**Library → New Skin** gives you:

- **Templates:** Empty, Steve (classic arms), Alex (slim arms)
- **Import from Minecraft:** enter a Minecraft username to pull that player's current skin
- **Upload a file:** drag and drop a PNG, or browse for one

Accepted uploads are PNGs sized **64×64**, **64×32** (old format), or **128×128**.

### Managing Skins

Each skin in the library can be:

- **Renamed** — the name is also used for exported files
- **Downloaded** — saves a PNG ready to upload to Minecraft (see [Use Your Skin in Minecraft](#use-your-skin-in-minecraft))
- **Deleted** — deleting the last skin leaves you with a fresh empty one

### Where Skins Are Stored

Skins live **locally on your device**, and every edit is saved automatically as you paint — so your work survives a reload. Because the storage is local, clearing your browser or app data will remove them. Download anything you don't want to lose.

---

## Use Your Skin in Minecraft

Downloading a skin saves a PNG on your device — nothing more. Minecraft doesn't look at that file until you upload it, so a skin that "doesn't show up in-game" has almost always just not been uploaded yet.

### Java Edition

1. Open the **Minecraft Launcher** and go to the **Skins** tab.
2. Choose **New skin**, then **Browse** and pick the PNG you downloaded.
3. Pick the arm style that matches the skin: **Classic** for 4px arms, **Slim** for 3px arms (the **Slim mode** setting in MineSkin PRO). A mismatch shows up as stray or missing pixels on the arms.
4. **Save & use**. The skin appears the next time you join a world or server.

You can also upload it from your profile on minecraft.net, under **Skin**.

### Bedrock Edition

1. From the main menu, open the **Dressing Room** below your character.
2. Choose **Edit Character**, then on the **Owned** tab pick **Import** and **Choose New Skin**.
3. Select the PNG, then choose the matching **Classic** or **Slim** model.
4. Confirm. Your character updates right away.

### If it still doesn't show

- **Wrong arm style** — upload again with the other model.
- **128×128 skins don't work on Java Edition.** Turn off **Double resolution** in **Settings → Actions** and download the skin again. Bedrock accepts 128×128.
- **Servers may not show custom skins.** Some servers run their own skin system, and others cache skins for a while. Check in a single-player world first, or restart the game.
- **Third-party launchers.** Skins belong to your Microsoft account, so uploading through the official Launcher or minecraft.net also works when you play through another launcher, as long as it signs in to that account.

---

## Brushes

The **Brushes** button in the left toolbar shows the brush you're currently using. Click it to open the brush panel — a side popover on desktop, a bottom sheet on touch devices.

- **Pen** (`P`) — paints a single pixel per click or drag
- **Bulk paint** (`U`) — fills a whole face, or a disc of pixels
- **Shading** (`V`) — darkens or lightens what's already there for depth
- **Dither** (`D`) — paints a 50% checkerboard of your color over what's underneath
- **Eraser** (`E`) — clears pixels back to transparent

### Brush Options

Each brush shows its own options in the panel:

- **Bulk paint → Radius:** `0` fills the entire face you clicked; `1`–`8` fills a disc of that many pixels around the hit. With a radius above 0 you can also choose a **Square** or **Circle** shape.
- **Shading → Intensity:** `1`–`6`, how strong each shading step is.
- **Eraser → Size:** `0`–`8`, shown as the resulting diameter in pixels.

Pen, shading, and dither always affect a single pixel, so they have no size control.

### Symmetry

**Symmetry** (`M`) mirrors every stroke onto the other side of the model — paint the left arm and the right arm follows. Toggle it from the brush panel. While it's on, a shortcut button appears in the toolbar so you can switch it off without opening the panel.

---

## Color

### Color Picker

The swatch at the top of the left toolbar opens the full picker:

- Pick from the saturation/lightness field and hue slider
- Type an exact **hex code**
- Set **opacity**
- Switch to the **Palette** tab to reuse colors already present in your skin

> Opacity only applies to the **armor (overlay) layer**. The body layer renders solid in-game, so paint there is always fully opaque.

### Eye Dropper (`I`)

Click the eye dropper button, then click any pixel on the 3D model to make its color your paint color.

---

## Reference Images

Press `R` or click the **Reference images** button to open the reference panel, docked beside the canvas in Editor mode.

- Add up to **12** images
- Drag on an image to aim, release to pick that color as your paint color
- **Zoom in / out / reset** to work with fine detail
- The **Colors in this image** row shows the image's dominant colors as swatches
- Remove images you're done with

---

## Body Parts and Layers

Every skin has two layers:

- **Body** — the base skin texture
- **Armor** — the overlay layer (hats, jackets, sleeves, pants)

Hide parts you're not working on to reach surfaces that are otherwise buried — for example, hide the armor layer to paint the head underneath it.

- **Desktop:** the parts panel sits in the top-right corner of the canvas
- **Touch:** tap the **Parts Filter** button in the toolbar to open it as a dialog

You can toggle each part individually (head, torso, arms, legs), or toggle a whole layer at once.

---

## Camera and View

### Rotation Gizmo

The gizmo in the top-right corner shows which way the camera is facing. Drag it to orbit around the model.

### Mouse and Touch

- **Drag:** orbit the camera
- **Scroll / pinch:** zoom in and out

The camera coasts after you release, with how much it carries controlled by the damping setting.

### Look at Cursor

In Preview mode on desktop, **Look at Cursor** makes the model's head follow your pointer around the screen.

### Camera Settings

Under **Settings → Preferences → Camera**:

- **Field of View** — how wide the perspective is
- **Movement Speed** — `0`–`0.5`, how fast the camera responds
- **Damping** — `0`–`1`, how quickly motion settles

> Fun fact: set damping to 0 and the camera will keep spinning forever.

---

## Grid

The **Grid** button in the toolbar (Editor mode) overlays pixel guides on the model, which helps with alignment and symmetry.

---

## Posing

The **Pose Limbs** button in the toolbar — or the `O` key — bends the model into a pose by hand. Two tools share the panel:

- **Move** — slides a limb's free end along one axis. Three arrows mark the axes.
- **Twist** — turns a limb around one axis. Three rings mark the axes.

Nothing is dragged freehand. Whichever arrow or ring your drag starts nearest is the one it follows, so the same gesture means the same thing from every camera angle.

### Mouse and Touch

- **Mouse** — drag any limb directly. Hovering lights up the arrow or ring the drag will use.
- **Touch** — tap a limb's handle first to bring up its arrows or rings, then drag one. A plain drag on the model still orbits the camera.
- Press `Esc`, or click empty space, to put the gizmo away.
- Press `O` again to leave pose mode. In the editor a brush shortcut (`P`, `U`, `V`, `D`, `E`) or the eyedropper (`I`) leaves it too, straight into that tool.

### The Torso

The torso has no joint of its own, so its handle drives the whole model instead: the arrows slide the skin through the scene, and the ring turns it on the spot. Both write the same values as the move and turn sliders in Settings, so the handle and the sliders always agree.

The built environments stand the model on their own ground and ignore the move offsets, so the torso's arrows go away there. Turning the model still works.

### Resetting

- **Reset Pose** clears the limbs.
- **Reset Position** puts the whole-model move and turn back to default.

They reset separately, so clearing a pose won't undo positioning you dialled in outside pose mode.

### Posing and Animations

The two are mutually exclusive: starting an animation switches posing off, and switching posing on stops the animation. Your pose is saved with the skin and comes back when you reload.

---

## Animations

In Preview mode, the **Animations** button plays the model through a loop:

- Idle
- Walking
- Running
- Flying
- Wave
- Crouch
- Hit

Choose **No Animation** to return the model to its rest pose.

---

## Screenshots and Clips

Both live in the Preview mode toolbar.

### Screenshot

Captures a square 1080×1080 PNG of the model, with a small MineSkin badge. You get a preview first, then choose to save or share it.

### Record Clip

Records a short vertical (9:16) video of your skin turning, badge included. A progress overlay appears while it renders, and you can cancel at any point. When it's done, preview the clip and then share or download it.

---

## Settings

Open the **Settings** panel with the gear icon in the toolbar. It has three tabs.

### Actions

- **Slim mode** — switches between classic (4px arms) and slim/"Alex" (3px arms). This modifies the skin texture, so you'll be asked to confirm.
- **Double resolution (128×128)** — doubles the texture resolution. Also a texture-modifying change. Note that **Minecraft (Java Edition) does not support 128×128 skins**.
- **Flip front to back** — swaps the front and back of every body part so the skin faces the other way.

### Preferences

**Paint** (Editor mode)

- **Variation Tool Intensity** — `1`–`6`

**Skin**

- **Surface Brightness** — `0`–`1`, diffuse lighting on the model
- **Shine / Glossiness** — `0`–`1`, specular highlights
- **Move Left/Right**, **Move Forward/Back**, **Move Up/Down** — `-100` to `100`
- **Tilt Up/Down**, **Turn Left/Right**, **Roll** — full rotation on each axis

> The three position sliders are locked while a 3D environment is active, since the environment places the model for you.

**Camera** — Field of View, Movement Speed, Damping (see [Camera and View](#camera-and-view))

**Light**

- **Main Light** — `0`–`1`, directional light strength
- **Light Left/Right**, **Light Up/Down**, **Light Forward/Back** — `-10` to `10`
- **Overall Brightness (Ambient Light)** — `0`–`1`, uniform base illumination

**Environment** — switch between backdrops:

- **Grid** — the default reference grid
- **Empty** — a plain gradient
- **Grassland Day** — an outdoor 3D scene
- **Arena** — a stylised indoor scene

**Language** — English, Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil)

**Appearance** — System, Light, or Dark theme

### Help

- Restart the interactive tutorial
- Report a problem (you can attach a screenshot; no account needed)
- Links to this guide, the changelog, the Discord server, and the GitHub repository
- Links to the iOS and Android apps

---

## History

- **Undo:** `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+Z` (Mac)
- **Redo:** `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`, or `⌘+Shift+Z` (Mac)
- Buttons for both sit in the left toolbar

> Undo history is **not** kept across a page reload. Your skin itself is saved, but the steps that got you there are cleared.

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Tools

- `P` — Pen
- `U` — Bulk paint
- `V` — Shading
- `D` — Dither
- `E` — Eraser
- `I` — Eye dropper
- `M` — Toggle symmetry
- `R` — Toggle the reference panel
- `O` — Toggle pose mode

### History

- `Ctrl/⌘ + Z` — Undo
- `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + Z` or `Ctrl + Y` — Redo

> Single-letter shortcuts are ignored while you're typing in a text field, so entering a hex code or renaming a skin won't switch tools.

---

## Touch and Mobile

The editor is fully touch-enabled:

- Drag to orbit, pinch to zoom
- The brush panel opens as a bottom sheet — the tool row always stays visible, and the chevron unfolds the color palette, symmetry, and the active brush's settings
- The parts filter opens as a full dialog

### Draw Mode vs View Mode

On touch devices in Editor mode, a single finger can either paint or move the camera — not both. The **Draw Mode / View Mode** button in the toolbar switches between them:

- **Draw Mode** — one finger paints; two fingers still pinch to zoom
- **View Mode** — one finger orbits the camera

---

## Apps

MineSkin PRO is also available as a native app on the **App Store** and **Google Play**, and as an installable web app (PWA) with offline support. The editor is the same in all of them.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Hide layers to reach what's under them** — the armor layer covers the body layer everywhere it's visible.
2. **Use the grid** when lining up details or matching both sides of the model.
3. **Symmetry saves half the work** on anything that mirrors — sleeves, legs, faces.
4. **Dither over flat fills** for texture that doesn't look painted on.
5. **Reference images beat guessing** — drop in artwork and pull colors straight from it.
6. **Download when you hit a milestone.** Skins are stored locally, and undo history doesn't survive a reload.
7. **Check your skin under different lighting** before exporting — the light settings will show you seams flat lighting hides.
